{"name":"LightStringGraph","tagline":"Lightweight String Graph Construction","body":"LightStringGraph\r\n================\r\n\r\nLightweight String Graph Construction\r\n\r\nThis software is in its initial stage of development.\r\nPlease contact [Marco Previtali](http://algolab.eu/people/previtali/) for any questions or use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/AlgoLab/LightStringGraph/issues) for reporting bugs.\r\n\r\n### Building and running LightStringGraph\r\n\r\nThe software is composed of three different tools: `lsg` (light (string) overlap graph), `redbuild` (string graph build), and `graph2asqg` (native graph format to ASQG).\r\n\r\nTo build both lsg and redbuild simply move in the root directory of the project and run `make all`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to try out the software on some (simulated or real) reads follow this steps:\r\n\r\n0. given a FASTA file `a.fa` containing `n` reads produce another FASTA file `b.fa` containing `2n` reads s.t. reads between position 1 and n are the same as `a.fa` and reads between position n+1 and 2n are the reverse complementd (for `1 <= i <= n`read in position `n+i` should be the reverse complement of read in position `i`)\r\n1. download and compile [BEETL](https://github.com/AlgoLab/BEETL) (**please note that this is not the original repository**)\r\n2. compile LightStringGraph `cd <LSGPATH> && make all`\r\n3. build the BWT of `b.fa` with `beetl-bwt -i b.fa -o <BWTPrefix> --output-format=ASCII --generate-lcp --generate-end-pos-file`\r\n4. run LightStringGraph `<LSGPATH>/bin/lsg -B <BWTPrefix> -T <Tau> -C <CycNum>` where `<Tau>` is the minimum overlap between reads and `<CycNum> >= <reads length> - <Tau>`\r\n5. run redbuild `<LSGPATH>/bin/redbuild -b <BWTPrefix> -r a.fa -m <CycNum>+1`\r\n6. optionally run graph2asqg `<LSGPATH>/bin/graph2asqg -b <BWTPrefix> -r b.fa -l <readsLength>` and redirect STDOUT (the string graph in the [ASQG format](https://github.com/jts/sga/wiki/ASQG-Format)) to a file (you can compress it on the fly).\r\n\r\n**If `lsg` crashes and produces a logic error try to raise the limit of file descriptor for the user running that command (delete all the `*.tmplsg.*` files before running `lsg` again)**\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
